## 🎮 About Cellularena - Winter Challenge 2024

**Cellularena** is a competitive programming puzzle that was part of CodinGame's Winter Challenge 2024. This challenge took place during the winter season of 2024 and involved:

- Strategic gameplay requiring algorithmic thinking
- Real-time decision-making under constraints
- Optimization of bot behavior for competitive play
- Analysis of game state and opponent strategies

Winter Challenges on CodinGame are limited-time events where thousands of developers compete to create the best AI bot for a specific game, with rankings determining the winners.

## 🎯 Repository Goal

The primary goals of this repository are:

1. **Save**: Preserve all iterations and versions of my code solutions
2. **Share**: Make my approaches and solutions available to others who want to learn
3. **Version Control**: Track the evolution of my strategies and implementations over time
4. **Documentation**: Document my thought process, algorithms, and optimization techniques

This repository serves as both a personal archive and a learning resource for anyone interested in competitive programming and AI bot development.
